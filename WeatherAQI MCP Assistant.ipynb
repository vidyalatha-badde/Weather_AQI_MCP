    "## WeatherAQI MCP Assistant\n",
    "**`WeatherAQI MCP Assistant`** is an interactive, asynchronous assistant that brings together real-time weather and AQI (Air Quality Index) data using powerful MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers. It seamlessly connects to dedicated weather and AQI tools on **Intel® Core™ Ultra Processors** then uses [**Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct**](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct) to analyze the data and generate clear, actionable health and safety recommendations. The Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct model is loaded using the [**PyTorch XPU backend**](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/get_start_xpu.html) to leverage Intel hardware acceleration.This assistant helps users stay informed about environmental conditions and make better decisions for their well-being. Designed with async operations and SSE connections, it’s perfect for modern, event-driven pipelines"

      "**Safety Level:** Good\n",
      "\n",
      "**Explanation:** The Air Quality Index (AQI) level is 1, which indicates good air quality. All pollutants are well within safe limits.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Health Risks\n",
      "**Health Risks:** Minimal\n",
      "\n",
      "**Explanation:** The levels of all pollutants are well below the threshold for causing health concerns. However, individuals with pre-existing respiratory or cardiovascular conditions may still be affected by poor air quality. \n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Precautions\n",
      "**Precautions:** None\n",
      "\n",
      "**Explanation:** Since the air quality is good, there are no specific precautions needed. Enjoy your day outdoors!\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Special Advice for Sensitive Groups\n",
      "**Special Advice:** No special precautions required.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Explanation:** Given the good air quality, there is no need for extra caution for sensitive groups such as children, elderly, pregnant women, and those with pre-existing respiratory or cardiovascular conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. What Can Be Done to Improve Air Quality in Hyderabad?\n",
      "**Improvement Suggestions:**\n",
      "1. **Promote Public Transport:** Encourage more people to use public transport to reduce vehicular emissions.\n",
      "2. **Industrial Emissions Control:** Implement stricter regulations on industrial emissions, particularly from power plants and factories.\n",
      "3. **Encourage Green Spaces:** Increase green cover through afforestation programs and urban greening initiatives.\n",
      "4. **Electric Vehicles:** Promote the adoption of electric vehicles and provide incentives for their usage.\n",
      "5. **Educate Public:** Raise awareness about the importance of clean air and encourage individuals to adopt eco-friendly practices.\n",
      "6. **Regular Monitoring:** Continue regular monitoring of air quality to identify trends and areas needing improvement.\n",
      "7. **Encourage Renewable Energy:** Support the growth of renewable energy sources to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.\n",
      "8. **Implement Emission Standards:** Update and enforce emission standards for vehicles and industrial facilities.\n",
      "9. **Promote Sustainable Agriculture:** Reduce the use of pesticides and promote sustainable farming practices.\n",
      "10. **Encourage Waste Management:** Improve waste management systems to reduce open burning and other pollution sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "By implementing these measures, the air quality in Hyderabad can gradually improve over time. \n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
