    "# WeatherAQI MCP Assistant\n",
    "**`WeatherAQI MCP Assistant`** is an interactive, asynchronous assistant that brings together real-time weather and AQI (Air Quality Index) data using powerful MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers. It seamlessly connects to dedicated weather and AQI tools, then uses a language model to analyze the data and generate clear, actionable health and safety recommendations. This assistant helps users stay informed about environmental conditions and make better decisions for their well-being. Designed with async operations and SSE connections, it’s perfect for modern, event-driven pipelines."

      "### 1. Overall Outdoor Safety Level\n",
      "The overall outdoor safety level is **Fair** (AQI Level: 2). This indicates that air quality is acceptable, but there may be some short-term health effects for sensitive individuals. It's generally safe to go outside, but it's advisable to take precautions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Health Risks\n",
      "Given the current conditions, the primary health risks are:\n",
      "- **Short-term effects:** Some people may experience eye irritation, coughing, and throat irritation due to elevated levels of particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O3).\n",
      "- **Long-term effects:** Prolonged exposure can lead to respiratory problems and cardiovascular issues, especially for those with pre-existing conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Precautions\n",
      "To mitigate health risks while enjoying outdoor activities like parasailing:\n",
      "- **Wear protective gear:** Use masks, sunglasses, and a hat to shield your face and eyes from harmful particles.\n",
      "- **Stay hydrated:** Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated, which helps in clearing the airways.\n",
      "- **Limit exposure time:** Reduce the duration of your activity if you feel discomfort.\n",
      "- **Avoid peak times:** Stay indoors during high pollution periods, typically early morning or late afternoon.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Special Advice for Sensitive Groups\n",
      "For individuals with respiratory or cardiovascular conditions:\n",
      "- **Monitor symptoms closely:** If you experience any unusual symptoms such as difficulty breathing, chest pain, or severe coughing, seek medical attention immediately.\n",
      "- **Consult healthcare provider:** Discuss your plans with your doctor to determine if it’s safe to engage in outdoor activities under these conditions.\n",
      "- **Use prescribed medications:** Ensure you have your prescribed inhalers or medications handy in case of an exacerbation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Can You Go for Parasailing Based on Weather Report?\n",
      "While it is generally safe to go for parasailing based on the overall safety level, it is recommended to:\n",
      "- Take extra precautions by wearing appropriate protective gear.\n",
      "- Monitor your health and symptoms during the activity.\n",
      "- Be prepared to end the session early if you feel unwell.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary\n",
      "- **Overall Safety Level:** Fair (AQI Level: 2)\n",
      "- **Health Risks:** Short-term effects for sensitive individuals; long-term risks for those with pre-existing conditions.\n",
      "- **Precautions:** Wear protective gear, stay hydrated, limit exposure time, avoid peak pollution periods.\n",
